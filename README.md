# Shell-aliases
My typing speed is around 80wpm(which is pretty fast!), I don't like typing a lot for some frequently occuring tasks. So, here is my solution in the form of `shell aliases`.

## Pros
- You'll use it a lot than normal commands because it's short(duh!).

## Cons
- You might forget the original commands because of using aliases too much(xD!).
